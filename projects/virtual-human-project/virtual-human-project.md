It won't be surprising to anyone who's built an AI assistant that measuring success can be subjective. Success can mean a lot of different things:
- Did the assistant correctly classify a message's intent and extract the right entities?
- Was the right response selected?
- Was the user's sentiment positive?
- Did the assistant help the user achieve their goal?
