# Cellular Automata Assignment: Diffusion-Limited Aggregation

Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is the process whereby particles undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together to form aggregates of such particles. This model was proposed to simulate certain types of aggregation, for instance metal ions diffusing through a fluid and sticking to a charged electrode. “Diffusion” because the particles forming the structure, also called Brownian tree or cluster, wander around randomly before attaching themselves (“aggregating”) to the structure. “Diffusion-limited” because the particles are considered to be in low concentrations and therefore don’t inter- act together. Other examples can be found in non-living and living nature, e.g. mineral deposition, snowflake growth, lightning paths or corals growth.
